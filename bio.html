  <h3>Bio:</h3>

  <p >
    I am a girl who enjoys dancing from Scotch Plains, NJ. I will be in the 12th grade in the fall,
  and I am looking forward to applying to colleges. Some choices I have looked at already include
  Temple University, UMBC, Howard University, and North Carolina A&T.  I live at home with my mom
  and dad. My sister is currently in college so she no longer lives at home with us.
  When I'm not dancing, I like to keep up with what is going on in the NBA and hanging out with my friends.

    <strong>Likes:</strong> My all-time favorite show is Dance Moms. My favorite dancer has changed constantly but
  my favorite group dance will forever be The Rose Garden <a href = "https://youtu.be/URRh9DMkhqU" > YouTube</a> .
    </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Dislikes:</strong> My least favorite food will forever be mashed potatoes. I also really hate caramelized
  onions and most baked goods.

    <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I have developed  severe knee issues so I have to get knee injections each month for 8 months.
